This is my github repo for storing my dotfiles for all the config i do. This config is very related to:
- My downloaded packages
- My operating system
- My hardware

even then, you can still download the dotfiles and packages and just modify them to your needs.

My setup was heavily influenced by maxhu08's dotfiles, this is basically just his setup but modifed.

You can visit maxhu08's github here:
- https://github.com/maxhu08/

There's a list of all my packages i downloaded using either pacman or yay which you can find in the dotfiles repo in 'installed-packages'
i'm gonna update the package list from time to time probably whenever i update the dotfiles repo.
